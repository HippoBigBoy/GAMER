Assumption 1: The file with provided with the Planets and their distances will always be in an excel format as
provided in the assignment zip
Potential Enhancement: Accept other files and formats of this data ie JSON, XML or other entry points ie an
external webservice call

Design Decision 1: I decided not to re-invent the wheel. I know of a good Apache library that has a great API for
interacting with Microsoft documents.

Assumption 2 : I assumed that the data provided in the document is a set ie it does not have any duplicates.
I have continued coding to this assumption but a possible improvement would be making the List of vertices I build
from the document bulletproof.

Design Decision 2: When combing through the data I found that the routes had a node L' that was not included
in the planets sheet. In this case my implementation will add the Planet to the Map before trying to creating
the edge for it. (NullPointerException). The name of a planet that appears in the routes but not in the planets
list will be a random String

Design Decision 3: The endpoints accept JSON and return JSON
