Assumption 1: The file with provided with the Planets and their distances will always be in an excel format as
provided in the assignment zip
Potential Enhancement: Accept other files and formats of this data ie JSON, XML or other entry points ie an
external webservice call

Design Decision: I decided not to re-invent the wheel. I know of a good Apache library that has a great API for
interacting with Microsoft documents.

Assumption 2 : I assumed that the data provided in the document is a set ie it does not have any duplicates.
I have continued coding to this assumption but a possible improvement would be making the List of vertices I build
from the document bulletproof.
